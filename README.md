* Breakout!

* Project by: Austin Windley and Kate Estabrook

* When program is run, player is presented with a choice of difficulty
When a difficulty is chosen, player is sent into a game of breakout where they
must hit the ball into every brick at the top of the screen without hitting the
bottom too many times. If player wins or loses, they may choose to play again
or quit. Higher difficulties increase the speed of the ball and lower

* Known bugs: Paddle overlap detection can sometimes be finicky on Mac. Ball will
sometimes go through the paddle. On Windows, however, the detections works great, so not
sure where the issue is. Video was recorded on Windows to avoid this issue. Also, in random a brick could
potentially be completely black making it very hard to win! Also, on random mode specifically has some errors
in brick collision.

* Future Work: There is lots of room in the graphical presentation. Could add fancier effects
when breaking bricks or shade them in more interesting ways. We could also add more transitions
through the levels to make a larger experience and could expand the theatrics of the death/end
screen.

* We think we have earned 120 points as we not only fulfilled every major requirement, but we
also added many screens and have decently complicated math on brick placement and ball velocity.

Hopefully we made you laugh with our dumb video! :)
